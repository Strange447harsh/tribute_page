        <h1>A. P. J. Abdul Kalam</h1>
        <h1>(1863-1902)</h1>
        <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015 was an
            Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was
            born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next
            four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
            Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's
            civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the
            Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
            technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
            Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

        <h1>Early life and education</h1>
        <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage
            centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His
            father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a
            housewife. His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between
            Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one
            sister in his family. His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with
            numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil
            Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved
            trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying
            pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914,
            however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the
            ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell
            newspapers to add to the family's meager income.

        <h1>Career as a scientist</h1>
        <p>
            After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development
            Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government
            of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He
            started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at
            DRDO.[26] Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] He was
            interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket
            Launching Station (TERLS).[27] In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation
            (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which
            successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on
            an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.In 1969, Kalam received the government's
            approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.
        </p>
        <h1>Death</h1>
        <p>On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the
            Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort,
            but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest.[85] At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into
            his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition;
            upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life.[86] Despite being placed in the intensive care
            unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST. His last words, to
            his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"</p>
